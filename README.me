Rebuilt Scouting App 2026 FRC 167

Version: 1.0 Team: Iowa City Robotics Season: 2026 (Reefscape)

An Android-based scouting application designed for offline data collection during FRC competitions. This app allows scouters to record match data, edit entries locally, and export data to a USB flash drive via JSON files.
    Features

    Match Scouting: Intuitive interface to track Auto, Teleop, and Endgame performance (Cycles, Defense, Climbing, etc.).

    Data Persistence: Automatically saves all matches to internal storage to prevent data loss even if the app closes.

    Data Editor: A text-based editor to view and modify previously saved match data to correct errors.

    Smart Export:

        One-Click Export: Automatically detects and exports only new (un-exported) matches to a USB drive.

        Full Backup: If no new matches exist, prompts the user to perform a full re-export of the entire database.

    Pit Scouting: (Planned) Interface for collecting static robot data (weight, drivetrain, etc.).

StorageManager.java	    Utility class for saving/loading JSON files to internal storage and writing exports to USB.
DataKeys.java	        Contains static constant strings (e.g., "auto_cycles") to ensure data tags are consistent.

Layouts (src/main/res/layout/)

    setup_screen.xml: Home UI with name input, match list, and export button.

    Teleop: Track active/inactive cycles and defense.

    Endgame: Record climb status and other endgame tasks.

    Save: Click "Save & Exit" to write data to internal storage.

3. Exporting Data

    Plug a USB-C Flash Drive (or adapter) into the device.

    On the Setup Screen, click the "Export to USB" button.

 Troubleshooting

    "App crashes on startup":

        Go to Phone Settings > Apps > RebuiltScoutingApp > Storage > Clear Storage/Data. Old/corrupt JSON files from previous versions can cause crashes.

    "Export button does nothing":

        Ensure you have a file manager app installed (like Files by Google).

        Verify the USB drive is formatted correctly (FAT32 or exFAT).

    Build Errors in Android Studio:

        Go to Build > Clean Project, then Rebuild Project.

        Go to File > Invalidate Caches / Restart.
